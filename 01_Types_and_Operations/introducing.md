Python programs can be decomposed into modules, statements, expressions, and objects.
1. Programs are composed of modules.
2. Modules contain statements.
3. Statements contains expressions.
4. Expressions create and process objects.
## Why Use Built-in Types?
+ Python provides powerful object types as an intrinsic part of the language, so there's usually no need to code object before you start solving problems.
+ **why you'd better use built-in object:**
	- they make program easy to write.
	- they are components of your extensions.
	- they are often more efficient than custom data structures.
	- they are a standard part of the language.
## Python's Core Data Types
| Object type | Example literal/creation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Numbers | 1234, 3.1415, 3+4j, Decimal, Fraction |
| Strings | 'spam', "apple's", b'a\x01c' |
| Lists | [1, [2, 'three'], 4] |
| Dictionaries | {'food': 'spam', 'taste': 'yum'} |
| Tuples | (1, 'spam', 4, 'U') |
| Files | myfile = open('filename.ext', 'r') |
| Other core types | Booleans, types, None |
| Program unit types | Functions, modules, classes |
| Implementation-related types | Compiled code, stack tracebacks |
